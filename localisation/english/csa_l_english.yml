 CSA_socdem_party:0 "SRDP - Longists"
 CSA_socdem_party_long:0 "States-Rights Democratic Party - Longists\n\n§g''The only way you'll be able to feed the balance is to make that man come back and bring back some of that grub he ain't got no business with!''\n\nThe career of Huey Long has been an enigma in the Confederacy; the lower-middle class salesman, turned lawyer, turned rabid populist demagogue; he has engineered the Louisiana political machine into his own fiefdom, a mighty machine that will bring him to the highest offices he can achieve.\n\nHuey Long's clique within the SRDP have spent the last five years deepening their claws within the party, orchestrating social reform and legislation via intimidation, authoritarian control and tactics more on-parr with a mob boss than a politician; and as his popularity only continues to rise on the national stage as he went from governor, to senator of Louisiana, he has become a parasite that the SRDP cannot yet remove from their body.\n§!"
 CSA_libdem_party:0 "SRDP - Welfarists"
 CSA_libdem_party_long:0 "States-Rights Democratic Party - Welfarists\n\n§gThe enigma that has been David Bibb Graves' career is rivaled only by Huey Long's career in it's strangeness.\n\nAchieving victory on a progressive platform by receiving an endorsement from the New Knights of the Golden Circle, D. Bibb Graves is a man who is not afraid to get his hands very, very dirty; all for the sake of his reformist platform.\n\nAdvocating for a welfare state with many surprisingly socially liberal ideals for a Southern politician, Graves has managed to gain national fame and respect from the people, all while shielding himself from a typically hostile congress with his Golden Circle connections.\n§!"
 CSA_condem_party:0 "SRDP - Moderates"
 CSA_condem_party_long:0 "States-Rights Democratic Party - Moderates\n\n§gDespite the SRDP typically being a political organization for corrupt business interests, with a generally authoritarian outlook on ruling. There has always been a part of the party that desires more democratic rule for the South; restricting corporate influence and enshrining what the Confederacy claimed to venerate oh so long ago: States Rights.\n§!"
 CSA_patdem_party:0 "SRDP - Conservative"
 CSA_patdem_party_long:0 "States-Rights Democratic Party - Conservative\n\n§gHaving formed shortly after the end of the War of Northern Aggression, the States-Rights Democratic Party is the oldest political entity in the Confederate States of America. Having control over a majority of Confederate Congress for the 75 years of the CSA's existence, the SRDP essentially serves as the de-facto ruling party, serving and carrying out the will of the South's various corporations, oligarchs and aristocrats.\n§!"
 CSA_Huey_party:0 "Dixieland First Party"
 CSA_Huey_party_long:0 "Dixieland First Party"
 CSA_autocrat_party:0 "C.S. Army"
 CSA_autocrat_party_long:0 "Confederate States Army\n\n§gAt the height of Confederate power under Robert E. Lee's presidency, the Confederate States Army could easily have been described as an army with a state; participation in the military was considered one of the highest honors a Southern boy could participate in, which only made all the more humiliating when the Confederacy barely won the Second War of Northern Aggression in 1884; almost capitulating to the United States before winning a dragged out war of attrition.\n\nThe glory days of the C.S. Army have long since passed. The Confederate Army is not quite what it used to be; but that is not to say it does not continue to exert incredible influence over the affairs of the state, and could not potentially interfere in the politics of the South, both indirectly and directly.\n§!"
 CSA_fascist_party:0 "NKGC"
 CSA_fascist_party_long:0 "New Knights of the Golden Circle\n\n§gFormed in the 1910's by William J. Simmons after he was inspired by Confederate propaganda films. The New Knights of the Golden Circle claims itself to be the spiritual successor of the original K.G.C. Venerating the ideas of Southern nationalism, anti-liberalism and extreme white supremacy, the N.K.G.C. desires to restore the “Old South”, achieving a totalitarian, Christian ultranationalist state.\n§!"

 CSA_oligarchy_desc: "Coming from the Greek words 'oligos', or 'few', and 'arkho', or 'to rule', an oligarchy is a government in which the systems of power are controlled by a small group of people, either through the veiled farce of a provisional government, or through more nefarious means. Often defined by their more authoritarian methods of control, oligarchies may ignore the needs of their people in favor of advancing the wills of the nation’s different oligarchs.\n\nOligarchy has defined the history of the Confederate States of America, as the political machine of the South, dominated by the States-Rights Democratic Party, is driven almost entirely by business interests and the whims of aristocrats."
### Character Descriptions ###
 politics_McAdoo_desc:0 "§YName: §gWilliam Gibbs McAdoo\n\n§YBorn: §g31st October, 1863. Marietta, Georgia, Confederate States of America.\n\n§YLife & Career: §gBorn in the middle of the War of Northern Aggression, as the nephew of a Confederate general; William Gibbs McAdoo was destined to find a neat place in the Southern machine. Initially working as an entrepreneur before moving onto a legal practice, he made a name for himself by taking charge of various infrastructure projects, aligning the stars for McAdoo to meet who would ultimately become the most influential man in McAdoo's life, and career: Woodrow Wilson.\n\nQuickly gaining Wilson's respect, McAdoo first found a position on Wilson's presidential cabinet, and then a position in Wilson's family, marrying his daughter, Eleanor Wilson; a marriage that would secure him a spot as the most powerful man in the South. McAdoo's leadership, however, has not been nearly as smooth as his rise to power. McAdoo has watched almost helplessly as the people of the South, black and white alike, become discontented with the order of the Confederate States; and while McAdoo has done all he can to fix the South's many problems, his health is beginning to fail him, and his time is running out; leaving McAdoo to wonder whether the South would be better off in a younger man's hands.§!"
 politics_Long_desc:0 ""
 politics_Hiram_desc:0 "'The white men were roused by a mere instinct of self-preservation..... until at last there had sprung into existance a great Ku Klux Klan, a veritable empire of the South, to protect the Southern country.'\n\nThe die has been cast, the degenerative, weak McAdoo has been ousted, his negro-worshipping cabinet lie in ditches, or huddle around prison camps, and, at last, a new order dawns upon the sultry, balmy south. As the Invisible Empire of the Southern country allows itself to be seen, whites across the country celebrate, once again proud of their racial purity, while the negros and their allies flee or hide. While the future of Hiram Wesley Evans' Confederacy is uncertain, one thing remains clear, that it will soon be a nation that is, truly, only for the white man, and the white man alone..."
 politics_russell_desc:0 "Richard Russell Jr. never wanted it to come this...\n\nFrom his childhood, Richard Russel Jr. had always wanted to be a man of importance, he had worked his way up through the political ladder of the South, becoming a govenor of Georgia and later the vice president for William G. McAdoo; his meteoric rise to fame seemed to have no ends, perhaps it could even take him the seat of the presidency one day...\n\nAnd now that the day has come, he wishes it could be any other way...\n\nRichard Russell Jr. has become the head of the South, and he has no idea what he can do with his new power, the political divides of the South are almost entirely unfixable, and all he can do now is bide his time and try to find the most favorable way to end the old order of the Confederacy."

### Character Traits ###
 csa_old_guard:0 "Face of the Confederate Oligarchy"

### National Spirits ###
 csa_great_depression:0 "Growing State of Malaise"
 csa_great_depression_desc:0 "After decades of decline, many people within the Confederate States simply cannot bear to live in the same never-ending cycle of misery. Many people have turned to extremist ideologies to cope with the countless flaws of the Confederate government; some fight for reform and liberty, others for self-proclaimed racial purity, faith and state. All have different goals, all have different ideals, all have different plans, but one belief is shared between them all:\n\nThe malaise §Rmust§! end, and something new has to break the cycle."
 csa_unsplendid_isolation:0 "Unsplendid Isolation"
 csa_unsplendid_isolation_desc:0 "The Confederate States of America was born into a world that was destined to oppose it; the nature of and importance of slavery in the nation led to the South earning the status of an international pariah, and it's place as a target for the British Empire's war on slavery.\n\nAt it's weakest moment, just after the Second War of Northern Aggression, the British Empire would send an ultimatum to the South that the Confederacy must abolish slavery immediately, or face a war it could not hope to win; the CSA took the easy way out, cementing isolationist sentiment. Combined with a generations worth of worsening immigration laws, the South has become an incredibly isolated nation; choosing neutrality in the Great War and involving itself very little in foreign affairs that are not within their own sphere of influence."

### National Focus ###

McAdoo has reigned as president and de-facto dicator of the Confederate States ever since his father in-law Woodrow Wilson surrendered the position to him in 1922. And after fourteen years of highs and lows, McAdoo himself is ready to retire as his health continues to decline."

 CSA_unite_cabinet_desc:0 "Richard Russell Jr. has prepared positions in his presidential cabinet for those he believes can help him the most in his presidency, we must ensure that the leftovers from McAdoo's cabinet work well with their new cabinet members."
 CSA_the_people:0 "Face the People"

 CSA_brace_storm_desc:0 "McAdoo has officially retired, leaving Richard Russell Jr. to pick up where he left off; and while the future could be bright, we must brace the storm of political turmoil and subvert extremist influence."

### Events ###
 Confederacy.1.t:0 "An Evening in the White House"
 Confederacy.1.d:0 "The sun had just begun to set as McAdoo stared out the window. A million thoughts raced through his head throughout the day, but watching the sun set always seemed to quell his frantic mind; here, he could condense his thoughts and concerns in a productive way. A new year had dawned upon the south, but with it, a million problems continued to rear their ugly heads.\n\nEconomic stagnation, Longist populism, African revolutionaries, attacks by the Klan, the list went on. Everyday a new issue was piled on, and everyday the situation become more dire. There wasn't one moment where McAdoo realized what was happening, there was no exact moment that made him realize just how truly dire his situation was, but there was a decline, a decline that only seemed to get worse and worse everyday. Every moment he didn't act, both his, and the South's chances got worse; and things can only get so bad before there are no more chances to take.\n\nAnd so McAdoo, for all his indecision and lack of action, finally did something; he sat down, and put pen to paper, a message to the government, a rallying cry, a final shot at solving the South's deepening crisis."
 Confederacy.1.a:0 "It's now or never."
 Confederacy.2.t:0 "Passing the Torch"
 Confederacy.2.d:0 "It was a typical afternoon for Richard Russell Jr., he had given a speech that morning, attended a committee hearing about the army budget, and settled into his office to get to work; it the same schedule as every other day. Even though things were starting to go from bad to worse, he couldn't do anything about it without consulting McAdoo and going through the brick wall that was the States-Rights Democratic Party.\n\nIt was then that McAdoo entered his office, Richard stood up at the old president hobbled over to his desk, sitting down.\n\n''Greetings, Mr. President, what do you need?'' Unhurried, McAdoo sat down, not saying a word; he took a deep breath, staring at Richard, and said: ''Dick, it's time for me to resign.'' It was of little surprise to Russell, McAdoo had continued to decline in health for last few years; it was about time, in his eyes. But Richard couldn't be sure what would become of him. ''What comes next for me, sir?'' McAdoo paused for a brief moment, before he said ‘'It's time for you to do what you think is best for the South.''"
 Confederacy.2.a:0 "Lets get to work."
 Confederacy.3.t:0 "A Final Farewell"
 Confederacy.3.d:0 "McAdoo cleared his throat as he sat down just behind the stage, mouthing words to himself before he was called onto the stage. This was it, the end of not only his career as a public servant, but his working-life entirely; he would finally retire to his home and leave behind the daily stresses and shame of public office. He lamented over what his father-in-law would be thinking right now, the man who personally picked him to take charge of the South. Would he be ashamed? Or would he understand? Little could be done about the many flaws of the Confederacy without going through a corrupted, miserable congress, more concerned with enjoying the prestige of public office, and a mountain of bribe money more than actually serving the people. He couldn’t think about it for much longer, though, as he heard his name called on the stage.\n\nMcAdoo creeped up to face his people for one final address, he would spend the next half-hour calmly reflecting upon his achievements and failures to the Southern people, leaving no mistake about his regrets, his successes, and his thoughts on the future of the nation. Eventually, his final message to the South was over, and he walked off stage, allowing the new Confederate president to address his people for the very first time."
 Confederacy.3.a:0 "There was no applause, for his resignation changed nothing."
 Confederacy.4.t:0 "Burnt Up"
 Confederacy.4.d:0 "Oh shit the JBL did a little trolling!"
 Confederacy.4.a:0 "Nazi Takeover Event Next"
