 CSA_socdem_party_long:0 "States-Rights Democratic Party - Longists\n\n§g''The only way you'll be able to feed the balance is to make that man come back and bring back some of that grub he ain't got no business with!''\n\nThe career of Huey Long has been an enigma in the Confederacy; the lower-middle class salesman, turned lawyer, turned rabid populist demagogue; he has engineered the Louisiana political machine into his own fiefdom, a mighty machine that will bring him to the highest offices he can achieve.\n\nHuey Long's clique within the SRDP have spent the last five years deepening their claws within the party, orchestrating social reform and legislation via intimidation, authoritarian control and tactics more on-parr with a mob boss than a politician; and as his popularity only continues to rise on the national stage as he went from governor, to senator of Louisiana, he has become a parasite that the SRDP cannot yet remove from their body.\n§!"
 CSA_libdem_party:0 "SRDP - Welfarists"
 CSA_libdem_party_long:0 "States-Rights Democratic Party - Welfarists\n\n§gThe enigma that has been David Bibb Graves' career is rivaled only by Huey Long's career in it's strangeness.\n\nAchieving victory on a progressive platform by receiving an endorsement from the New Knights of the Golden Circle, D. Bibb Graves is a man who is not afraid to get his hands very, very dirty; all for the sake of his reformist platform.\n\nAdvocating for a welfare state with many surprisingly socially liberal ideals for a Southern politician, Graves has managed to gain national fame and respect from the people, all while shielding himself from a typically hostile congress with his Golden Circle connections.\n§!"
 CSA_condem_party:0 "SRDP - Moderates"
 CSA_condem_party_long:0 "States-Rights Democratic Party - Moderates\n\n§gDespite the SRDP typically being a political organization for corrupt business interests, with a generally authoritarian outlook on ruling. There has always been a part of the party that desires more democratic rule for the South; restricting corporate influence and enshrining what the Confederacy claimed to venerate oh so long ago: States Rights.\n§!"
 CSA_patdem_party:0 "SRDP - Conservative"
 CSA_patdem_party_long:0 "States-Rights Democratic Party - Conservative\n\n§gHaving formed shortly after the end of the War of Northern Aggression, the States-Rights Democratic Party is the oldest political entity in the Confederate States of America. Having control over a majority of Confederate Congress for the 75 years of the CSA's existence, the SRDP essentially serves as the de-facto ruling party, serving and carrying out the will of the South's various corporations, oligarchs and aristocrats.\n§!"

 CSA_Huey_party_long:0 "Dixieland First Party"
 CSA_autocrat_party:0 "C.S. Army"
 CSA_autocrat_party_long:0 "Confederate States Army\n\n§gAt the height of Confederate power under Robert E. Lee's presidency, the Confederate States Army could easily have been described as an army with a state; participation in the military was considered one of the highest honors a Southern boy could participate in, which only made all the more humiliating when the Confederacy barely won the Second War of Northern Aggression in 1884; almost capitulating to the United States before winning a dragged out war of attrition.\n\nThe glory days of the C.S. Army have long since passed. The Confederate Army is not quite what it used to be; but that is not to say it does not continue to exert incredible influence over the affairs of the state, and could not potentially interfere in the politics of the South, both indirectly and directly.\n§!"
 CSA_fascist_party:0 "SRDP - Radicals"
 CSA_fascist_party_long:0 "States-Rights Democratic Party - Radicals\n\n§gThe term ‘‘radical’’ does not even begin to describe the drastic nature of the States-Rights Democratic Parties most right-wing clique. Led by Baptist minister turned politician Thomas Dixon Jr., this clique has grown substantially in the last ten years, influencing millions of Southerners, all thanks to the writings, films, and other propaganda pieces of Thomas Dixon Jr.\n§!"
 KGC_fascist_party:0 "NKGC"
 KGC_fascist_party_long:0 "New Knights of the Golden Circle\n\n§gFormed in the 1910's by William J. Simmons after he was inspired by Confederate propaganda films. The New Knights of the Golden Circle claims itself to be the spiritual successor of the original K.G.C. Venerating the ideas of Southern nationalism, anti-liberalism and extreme white supremacy, the N.K.G.C. desires to restore the “Old South”, achieving a totalitarian, Christian ultranationalist state.\n§!"

 CSA_oligarchy_desc: "Coming from the Greek words 'oligos', or 'few', and 'arkho', or 'to rule', an oligarchy is a government in which the systems of power are controlled by a small group of people, either through the veiled farce of a provisional government, or through more nefarious means. Often defined by their more authoritarian methods of control, oligarchies may ignore the needs of their people in favor of advancing the wills of the nation’s different oligarchs.\n\nOligarchy has defined the history of the Confederate States of America, as the political machine of the South, dominated by the States-Rights Democratic Party, is driven almost entirely by business interests and the whims of aristocrats."

As the Invisible Empire of the Southern country allows itself to be seen, whites across the country celebrate, once again proud of their racial purity, while the negros and their allies flee or hide. While the future of Hiram Wesley Evans' Confederacy is uncertain, one thing remains clear, that it will soon be a nation that is, truly, only for the white man, and the white man alone..."
 politics_russell_desc:0 "Richard Russell Jr. never wanted it to come this...\n\nFrom his childhood, Richard Russel Jr. had always wanted to be a man of importance, he had worked his way up through the political ladder of the South, becoming a govenor of Georgia and later the vice president for William G. McAdoo; his meteoric rise to fame seemed to have no ends, perhaps it could even take him the seat of the presidency one day...\n\nAnd now that the day has come, he wishes it could be any other way...\n\nRichard Russell Jr. has become the head of the South, and he has no idea what he can do with his new power, the political divides of the South are almost entirely unfixable, and all he can do now is bide his time and try to find the most favorable way to end the old order of the Confederacy."

 politics_McAdoo_desc:0 "§YName: §gWilliam Gibbs McAdoo\n\n§YBorn: §g31st October, 1863. Marietta, Georgia, Confederate States of America.\n\n§YLife & Career: §gBorn in the middle of the War of Northern Aggression, as the nephew of a Confederate general; William Gibbs McAdoo was destined to find a neat place in the Southern machine. Initially working as an entrepreneur before moving onto a legal practice, he made a name for himself by taking charge of various infrastructure projects, aligning the stars for McAdoo to meet who would ultimately become the most influential man in McAdoo's life, and career: Woodrow Wilson.\n\nQuickly gaining Wilson's respect, McAdoo first found a position on Wilson's presidential cabinet, and then a position in Wilson's family, marrying his daughter, Eleanor Wilson; a marriage that would secure him a spot as the most powerful man in the South. McAdoo's leadership, however, has not been nearly as smooth as his rise to power. McAdoo has watched almost helplessly as the people of the South, black and white alike, become discontented with the order of the Confederate States; and while McAdoo has done all he can to fix the South's many problems, his health is beginning to fail him, and his time is running out; leaving McAdoo to wonder whether the South would be better off in a younger man's hands.§!"

### Character Traits ###
 csa_old_guard:0 "Face of the Confederate Oligarchy"

### National Spirits ###
 csa_great_depression:0 "Rising Tensions"
 csa_great_depression_desc:0 "After decades of decline, many people within the Confederate States simply cannot bear to live in the same never-ending cycle of misery. Many people have turned to extremist ideologies to cope with the countless flaws of the Confederate government; some fight for reform and liberty, others for self-proclaimed racial purity, faith and state. All have different goals, all have different ideals, all have different plans, but one belief is shared between them all:\n\nThe malaise §Rmust§! end, and something new has to break the cycle."
 csa_unsplendid_isolation:0 "Unsplendid Isolation"
 csa_unsplendid_isolation_desc:0 "The Confederate States of America was born into a world that was destined to oppose it; the nature of and importance of slavery in the nation led to the South earning the status of an international pariah, and it's place as a target for the British Empire's war on slavery.\n\nAt it's weakest moment, just after the Second War of Northern Aggression, the British Empire would send an ultimatum to the South that the Confederacy must abolish slavery immediately, or face a war it could not hope to win; the CSA took the easy way out, cementing isolationist sentiment. Combined with a generations worth of worsening immigration laws, the South has become an incredibly isolated nation; choosing neutrality in the Great War and involving itself very little in foreign affairs that are not within their own sphere of influence."
 csa_slavery_legacy:0 "Extremely Segregated Society"
 csa_slavery_legacy_desc:0 "When the institution of slavery was abolished in 1886, it was quickly replaced by extreme segregation laws that ensured the persisted dominance of the white elite over the new freedmen population. Their movement between white and black communities heavily regulated, their neighborhoods blocked off from white areas. Constantly oppressed by police, and with racially motivated violence frequently being ignored by authorities, the Confederate government is nothing but hated amongst the black community, leading to the foundation of organizations like the John Brown League."

McAdoo has reigned as president and de-facto dicator of the Confederate States ever since his father in-law Woodrow Wilson surrendered the position to him in 1922.

 CSA_root_evil_desc:0 "There may be no man more dangerous in the entire South than Thomas Dixon Jr., his violent, radical beliefs have infected our nation's soul, and his insidious desire for power is concerning to say the least. It is about time we keep a closer eye on him and prevent him from doing something drastic in these dire times."
 CSA_rally_srdp:0 "Rally the SRDP"
 CSA_rally_srdp_desc:0 "In these chaotic times, we, as a party and a people must unite to prevent the South from falling to anarchy. The States-Rights Democratic Party, for all its factions, must come together to save the South."

 CSA_the_jbl:0 "The John Brown League"
 CSA_the_jbl_desc:0 "A target of much hatred and fear amongst the right, the John Brown League is a left-wing terrorist organization dedicated to the ''Liberation'' of the black Southerner, using violence and agitation in an attempt to create a socialist state, it is about time we more effectively utilized the national guard against these pests."

### Events ###
 Confederacy.1.t:0 "An Evening in the White House"
 Confederacy.1.d:0 "McAdoo sat at the windowsill as he watched the world go by. It had been another long day of work, passing legislation and arguing with his cabinet. The constant cycle, it had a way of eating at you. After all the work he had put in, after the countless hours sacrificed, he had finally joined millions of other Southerners in feeling one emotion: Malaise.\n\nFor the first time in awhile, he really started to think about what was going on; he was an old man with progressively failing health, leading a nation of rising political violence, economic turmoil and festering hatred. All of these would be difficult enough to deal with as a younger man, but for the 73 year old McAdoo, was it even possible to cope with this much stress any longer.\n\nAs the most powerful man in the South pondered his fate and future, he finally came to a conclusion, and simply thought to himself:"
 Confederacy.1.a:0 "''Quit while you're ahead.''"
 Confederacy.2.t:0 "Passing the Torch"
 Confederacy.2.d:0 "It was a typical afternoon for Richard Russell Jr., he had given a speech that morning, attended a committee hearing about the army budget, and settled into his office to get to work; it the same schedule as every other day. Even though things were starting to go from bad to worse, he couldn't do anything about it without consulting McAdoo and going through the brick wall that was the States-Rights Democratic Party.\n\nIt was then that McAdoo entered his office, Richard stood up at the old president hobbled over to his desk, sitting down.\n\n''Greetings, Mr. President, what do you need?'' Unhurried, McAdoo sat down, not saying a word; he took a deep breath, staring at Richard, and said: ''Dick, it's time for me to resign.'' It was of little surprise to Russell, McAdoo had continued to decline in health for last few years; it was about time, in his eyes. But Richard couldn't be sure what would become of him. ''What comes next for me, sir?'' McAdoo paused for a brief moment, before he said ‘'It's time for you to do what you think is best for the South.''"
 Confederacy.2.a:0 "Lets get to work."
 Confederacy.3.t:0 "A Final Farewell"
 Confederacy.3.d:0 "McAdoo cleared his throat as he sat down just behind the stage, mouthing words to himself before he was called onto the stage. This was it, the end of not only his career as a public servant, but his working-life entirely; he would finally retire to his home and leave behind the daily stresses and shame of public office. He lamented over what his father-in-law would be thinking right now, the man who personally picked him to take charge of the South. Would he be ashamed? Or would he understand? Little could be done about the many flaws of the Confederacy without going through a corrupted, miserable congress, more concerned with enjoying the prestige of public office, and a mountain of bribe money more than actually serving the people. He couldn’t think about it for much longer, though, as he heard his name called on the stage.\n\nMcAdoo creeped up to face his people for one final address, he would spend the next half-hour calmly reflecting upon his achievements and failures to the Southern people, leaving no mistake about his regrets, his successes, and his thoughts on the future of the nation. Eventually, his final message to the South was over, and he walked off stage, allowing the new Confederate president to address his people for the very first time."
 Confederacy.3.a:0 "There was no applause, for his resignation changed nothing."
 Confederacy.4.t:0 "Moderate Congressmen Introduce the ''Domestic Espionage Act''"
 Confederacy.4.d:0 "Today, in the Confederate Congress, members of the moderate faction of the party introduced the ''Domestic Espionage Act'', a bill meant to knock down some of the bureaucratic struggles in the way of our ability to crack down on political extremists and terrorists. While the moderates and liberals within the States-Rights Democratic Party have already voiced their support, we will have a great struggle in not only swaying the Conservative faction, but also the Longists and far-right radicals of Thomas Dixon Jr.’s clique."
 Confederacy.4.a:0 "Here's hoping it passes..."
 Confederacy.7.t:0 "A Theory's Last Test"
 Confederacy.7.d:0 "Just now reporting in from a Congressional session, the Confederate House of Representatives almost unanimously voted in favor of approving the Domestic Espionage Bill, which was quickly followed up by approval from a majority of the Senate, and then signed by President Richard Russell Jr.\n\nRecieving praise from many moderates, the President and his cabinet are celebrating the victory, although much more work needs to be done to make sure the agitators in the John Brown League and New Knights of the Golden Circle are crushed forever."
 Confederacy.7.a:0 "It passed. At last, the South can breathe a sigh of relief."
 Confederacy.7.b:0 "It failed... Now what?"
