 communism_desc:0 "In the year 1777, French author Victor d'Hupay would publish 'Project for a Philisophical Community'. In this book, he would explain his ideal view for society, advocating for the common ownership of all economic and material products between the inhabitants of a local community, a 'commune'. This idea, of course, required a name: Communism.\n\nOver the next few centuries, this ideology would evolve as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels created a clear doctrine for Communism.\n\nAiming for a classless, stateless society, in where common ownership of the means of production allow for free distribution thereof according to one's needs. Communism advocates for the violent destruction of the bourgeoisie and the establishment of a 'dictatorship of the proletariat', a society where the government, state and working class are synonymous."

 socialism_desc:0 "Socialism is an ideology of many faces. To some, it is a path to an ideal society, in where democracy dominates the workplace, in where the classes of society will cooperate and work to create a better world. To others, it is a torch and sword to free the working class from the tyranny of capitalism and the bourgeoisie, in where revolution will bring justice crashing down on the exploitative upper class.\n\nNo matter what, Socialism's ultimate goal is the creation of a society in where the means of production are socially owned, desiring to create a just, fairer economy in where workers rights are protected."

Opposing social injustices like racism, sexism, etc. And advocating for a welfare state, with saftey-nets for the common man against hardship and financial ruin.\n\nBelieving the government's goal is to safeguard the weak.

 liberalism_desc:0 "In 1685, a movement would begin that would change the course of human history. It started in coffee houses in cities like London and Vienna, but it's influence would soon grow. From coffee houses to assemblies, from from the shores of England to those of the new world, and as the residents of the 13 American colonies began to rise up from their British overlords. These enlightened ideas would become the guiding base behind a new movement blossemed from the American Revolution of 1776: Liberalism.\n\nThe arch enemy of authoritarianism, Liberlism claims to recognize the self-evident truth of the universe in that all men are created equal, guaranteed a natural right to equality, liberty and representation, no matter their upbringing or social standing."

 conservatism_desc:0 "Conservatism as an ideology can be many things. However, above all else, it is an ideology that is united in concern for the preservation, protection, and refinment of tradition, society and government.\n\nDespite it's name, conservatism does not entirely imply the abscence of liberalism, as many Conservatives are not opposed to working with liberals, especially in the world of economics, where many advocate for a laissez-faire model of economics. Overall, Conservative democracies focus on a more moderate method of government management, reform and change than it's liberal counterparts."

 oligarchy_desc:0 "While the specific circumstances and influence of an oligarchy differ from regime to regime, one thing remains a constant throughout their nations, the fact that they are, indeed, an oligarchy.\n\nComing from the Greek words 'oligos', or 'few', and 'arkho', or 'to rule', an oligarchy is a government in which the reins of power are held by a small group of people, either through the veiled farce of a provisional government, or through more nefarious, blatantly illegal means."

Despite the sham of a democracy they claim to be, the Confederacy has always been controlled by the aristocratic plantation families which formed it, aristocratic families whose frequent, obnoxious escapades and exploitation of both white and black workers has led to an angry, confused and violent populace."
 populistsocdem:0 "Southern Progressivism"
 populistsocdem_desc:0 "'A man is not a dictator when he is given a commision from the people and carries it out.'\n\nIn 1928, a certain Huey Pierce Long Jr. would ascend to the govenorship of the Southern state of Louisiana, and ever since, his bizarre leadership over Louisiana has made him, and his ideals of fiscal equality, anti-establishment populism, and civic nationalism have made him a beloved political figure amongst the South for people of all races and creeds. And so, under his wing, a new movement was born, a movement of Southern Progressivism.\n\nEspousing most of the typical beliefs of progressive movements around the world, Southern Progressivism advocates for radical reforms to bring fiscal equality to the nation using authoritarian and often violent means, all with the intended purpose of creating a new, more economically equal nation in which the people might be proud of their nationality; none shall be too poor, none shall be too wealthy, none shall be overworked, and none shall be idle. All the while ignoring the 'uglier' questions of a society like civil rights for minorities, in hopes of not angering their own support base."
