 usa_resurgent:0 "America Resurgent"
 usa_resurgent_desc:0 "The dream, after all, is not dead.\n\nWith our hasty intervention in the Great War, and our victory over the Entente, decades of humiliation, despair, and weakness have at last come to an end! America has entered the 20th century as a new nation, united and indivisible, ready to avenge the catastrophes of the 1860's and 80's."
 usa_progressive_era:0 "Fruits of the Progressive Era"
 usa_progressive_era_desc:0 "Over the last few decades, US politics has come to be dominated by populism, progressivism, and various left-wing ideologies. During the Roosevelt and La Follette presidencies especially, the US saw a large scale rise in antitrust and workers rights laws made to promote competition and prevent exploitation.\n\nAmericans today enjoy a plethora of workers rights and protections the previous generations did not; resulting in a happy, healthy, and most importantly, supportive populace; one which will gladly support a progressive government in future endeavors."
 usa_polarization:0 "Deeply Partisan Politics"
 usa_polarization_desc:0 "While progressive politics may dominate much of Congress, they share a battleground with hardlining socialists, authoritarian democrats, and far-right populists. Congress can reguarly transform into an ugly affair as delagates viciously fight over issues, a reality which has put major strain on the United States' political stability."
