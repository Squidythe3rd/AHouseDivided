### Parties ###
 USA_communist_party:0 "CPUSA"
 USA_communist_party_long:0 "Communist Party USA\n\n§gThe 20th century has been kind to American socialism, the SPA has reached national popularity and socialist beliefs influence much of American politics.\n\nBut for some socialists, these are only half-measures, distractions to prevent the worker from looking at the big picture, the true scope of capitalist exploitation in America, exploitation that the Communist Party of the USA cannot ignore.\n\nForming in the twenties as a radical alternative to the established SPA, the Communist Party of the USA is heavily influenced by Bolshevism and the works of Vladimir Lenin, desiring the achievement of a socialist state by force, until socialism can be achieved§! §Rfrom London to Havana, and from Berlin to New York.\n§!"
 USA_socialist_party:0 "SPA"
 USA_socialist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America\n\n§gFounded only in 1901, the fact that a socialist party in North America could reach the popularity and support the Socialist Party of America has, is simply incredible.\n\nFounded by the radical populists and labor unions in opposition to perceived moderatism in the Progressive and Populist parties, the Socialist Party of America advocates for democratic socialism in America, opposing restricted capitalism in favor of further advancement government regulation, workplace democracy and civil rights.\n§!"
 USA_socdem_party:0 "PPP - Progressive"
 USA_socdem_party_long:0 "Populist-Progressive Pact - Progressive\n\n§gA coalition between the agrarian, rural Populist Party and the urban, industrial Progressive Party, the Progressive-Populist Pact has defined the United States for the last 40 years. Becoming America’s most powerful party after leading America to victory in the Great War under Theodore Roosevelt’s leadership.\n\nCarrying on Roosevelt’s legacy, the Progressive Party sticks to it’s Rooseveltian roots, advocating for a mixed market, capitalist society in where the government prevents monopolies and protects workers rights, while also pursuing a dominant foreign policy to further American interests.\n§!"
 USA_libdem_party:0 "PPP - Populist"
 USA_libdem_party_long:0 "Populist-Progressive Pact - Populist\n\n§gA coalition between the agrarian, rural Populist Party and the urban, industrial Progressive Party, the Progressive-Populist Pact has defined the United States for the last 40 years. Becoming America’s most powerful party after leading America to victory in the Great War under Theodore Roosevelt’s leadership.\n\nPredating the Progressive Party by decades, the Populist Party used to push a far more radical agrarian political platform, but has become far more moderate in recent time. Enjoying support from the rural and more moderate regions of the country, a support base that is shrinking as America moves towards more radical options\n\nIf the Populist Party is to survive, it must adapt, but what direction shall it go in? Moderation? Or radicalism?\n§!"
 USA_condem_party:0 "GRP"
 USA_condem_party_long:0 "Grand Republican Party\n\n§gEspousing itself as the formal continuation of the long-dead party of the 1860’s, the Grand Republican Party is America’s definitive center-right political party, pushing for a more conservative approach to economic policy, while continuing the old Republican tradition of black suffrage and rights into its modern logical conclusion, championing civil rights both at home, and abroad as they focus their ire in on the Southern menace.\n§!"
 USA_patdem_party:0 "Democrats"
 USA_patdem_party_long:0 "Democratic Party\n\n§gLosing it’s southern sympathizing Copperhead faction in 1867, the Democrats have remained much the same for nearly a century.\n\nNever letting go of McClellan’s revanchist stance, the Democratic Party is a right-wing, pro-war party determined to restore America’s borders in the South, while also pushing socially conservative ideals such as prohibition, Christian democracy, and anti-welfare and labor rights rhetoric; rhetoric which typically results in them being associated with America’s nationalist, wealthy elite.\n§!"
 USA_autocrat_party:0 "NPP - Mainstream"
 USA_autocrat_party_long:0 "National Peace Party - Mainstream\n\n§gThe surviving remnant of the Copperhead faction of the Democratic Party, the National Peace Party is, in reality, one of the oldest surviving political entities in the United States. And perhaps one of the most controversial.\n\nIt was the Copperheads, under president George H. Pendleton who would grant peace and independence to the Confederate States of America; and from then, to their split with the Democrats in 1867, to now, the Peace Democrats, now known as the NPP, would remain relatively on the fringe.\n\nToday, the NPP enjoys a solid, yet small base of fringe right-wingers, strict anti-socialists, and the remaining regions of the US with Southern sympathies.\n§!"
 USA_fascist_party:0 "NPP - Radical"
 USA_fascist_party_long:0 "National Peace Party - Radical\n\n§gEven within the NPP’s radical right-wing nature, there lies an even more bigoted, radical and hostile wing of the party. Extremely sympathetic to the Confederacy, deeply anti-semitic, and incredibly authoritarian, this ultranationalist wing of the NPP has become a key part of why the party is now a national pariah, a sick joke in American democracy that needs to die.\n§!"

 usa_resurgent:0 "America Resurgent"
 usa_resurgent_desc:0 "After decades of humiliation, America has once again stepped onto the world stage as a major power; having hastily won the Great War against the Entente, the US now involves itself in a number of nationalist empire building projects, attempting to expand its influence abroad with the support of the population."
 usa_progressive_era:0 "Fruits of the Progressive Era"
 usa_progressive_era_desc:0 "Over the last few decades, US politics has come to be dominated by populism, progressivism, and various left-wing ideologies. During the Roosevelt and La Follette presidencies especially, the US saw a large scale rise in antitrust and workers rights laws made to promote competition and prevent exploitation.\n\nAmericans today enjoy a plethora of workers rights and protections the previous generations did not; resulting in a happy, healthy, and most importantly, supportive populace; one which will gladly support a progressive government in future endeavors."
 usa_polarization:0 "Deeply Partisan Politics"
 usa_polarization_desc:0 "While progressive politics may dominate much of Congress, they share a battleground with hardlining socialists, authoritarian democrats, and far-right populists. Congress can reguarly transform into an ugly affair as delagates viciously fight over issues, a reality which has put major strain on the United States' political stability."
