 politics_McAdoo_desc:0 "Little can be said about William Gibbs McAdoo that has not already been said. His wildly unpopular, shapeless reign, a bizarre mix of his equally unpopular father-in-law Woodrow Wilson's policies, and his own shallow attempts at reforms make him an easy target for all parts of the Confederacy's political spectrum to despise.\n\nHis father-in-law he is not, and his horrific mismanagement of the economy and nation over the Depression has made it clear that soon enough, someone will be moving to take his place..."

 politics_Hiram_desc:0 "'The white men were roused by a mere instinct of self-preservation..... until at last there had sprung into existance a great Ku Klux Klan, a veritable empire of the South, to protect the Southern country.'\n\nThe die has been cast, the degenerative, weak McAdoo has been ousted, his negro-worshipping cabinet lie in ditches, or huddle around prison camps, and, at last, a new order dawns upon the sultry, balmy south. As the Invisible Empire of the Southern country allows itself to be seen, whites across the country celebrate, once again proud of their racial purity, while the negros and their allies flee or hide. While the future of Hiram Wesley Evans' Confederacy is uncertain, one thing remains clear, that it will soon be a nation that is, truly, only for the white man, and the white man alone..."
 politics_russell_desc:0 "Richard Russell Jr. never wanted it to come this...\n\nFrom his childhood, Richard Russel Jr. had always wanted to be a man of importance, he had worked his way up through the political ladder of the South, becoming a govenor of Georgia and later the vice president for William G. McAdoo; his meteoric rise to fame seemed to have no ends, perhaps it could even take him the seat of the presidency one day...\n\nAnd now that the day has come, he wishes it could be any other way...\n\nRichard Russell Jr. has become the head of the South, and he has no idea what he can do with his new power, the political divides of the South are almost entirely unfixable, and all he can do now is bide his time and try to find the most favorable way to end the old order of the Confederacy."
 politics_Zemurray_desc:0 "Born to a impoverished Jewish family in the rampantly anti-semitic Russian Empire, Samuel Zemurray grew up to be a man who take what could to survive in a world poised against him. And take what he could, he did. Investing in Central American plantations and fruit farms, Zemurray quickly accumulated a vast pool of wealth and a stake in the Confederacy's influence in Central America.\n\nEventually, he would become the most powerful man in Central America, with his company, the Confederate Fruit Company, owning a majority share in most plantations across the entirety of Central America."
 politics_philip_follette_desc:0 "Born at the very beginning of the rise of the Progressive Party, Philip La Follete was lucky enough to be born into one of the most influential dynasties in modern American politics. Son of the iconic ‘Fighting Bob’, Philip spent his entire life being prepared for a political career. Fighting valiantly on the Canadian front of the Great War, and working hard as the governor of Wisconsin, he had long set himself up for a potential presidential campaign, one which he carried out and won.\n\nAs president, La Follete has promised to carry on with the progressive agenda laid out by the Roosevelt administration. Promising to finally bring America out of the depression entirely, but as the heat cranks up again, and the hated Confederacy takes a turn for the worse, one question must be asked…\n\nCan Philip La Follette hold on?”
